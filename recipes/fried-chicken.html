    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken, cut into pieces (or your choice of chicken parts)</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk (or regular milk)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong> Rinse the chicken pieces under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. This helps the breading adhere better to the chicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> Place the chicken pieces in a large bowl and pour the buttermilk over them, ensuring each piece is coated. Cover the bowl and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight for maximum flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Breading:</strong> In a shallow dish or bowl, mix together the flour, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, dried thyme, and dried oregano until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the Chicken:</strong> Remove the marinated chicken pieces from the buttermilk and dredge them in the seasoned flour mixture, making sure they are evenly coated on all sides. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong> In a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven, heat enough vegetable oil to cover the chicken pieces halfway (about 2 inches deep) over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (180°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Chicken:</strong> Taste the sisig and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper according to your preference.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Serve:</strong> Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the oil and transfer it to a wire rack or paper towels to drain excess oil. Let it rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy:</strong> Serve the crispy fried chicken hot, alongside your favorite sides such as mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or biscuits. Optionally, drizzle with honey or hot sauce for extra flavor. Enjoy your delicious homemade fried chicken!</li>
