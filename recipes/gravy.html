    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A rich and savory sauce, crafted from pan drippings, broth, and flour. Smooth and velvety in texture, with a depth of flavor that complements roasted meats and mashed potatoes alike. Its comforting aroma and luxurious taste elevate any meal, turning the ordinary into the extraordinary.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup pan drippings (from roasted meat)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken or beef broth (homemade or store-bought)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare Pan Drippings: </strong> After roasting meat, pour the pan drippings into a measuring cup or small bowl, leaving behind any burnt bits. If there's not enough fat, you can supplement with butter or oil to reach 1/4 cup.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Roux:</strong> In a saucepan over medium heat, add the pan drippings. Once heated, sprinkle in the flour gradually, stirring constantly to combine. Cook the roux for 2-3 minutes until it turns a golden brown color.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Broth:</strong> Slowly pour in the chicken or beef broth while whisking continuously to prevent lumps from forming. Keep whisking until the mixture is smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer:</strong> Bring the gravy to a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally. Let it cook for about 5-10 minutes, or until it reaches your desired thickness. If it's too thick, you can add more broth to thin it out.</li>
        <li><strong>Season: </strong> Taste the gravy and season with salt and pepper according to your preference. Keep in mind that if you used salted broth or the pan drippings are already seasoned, you may need less salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once the gravy has reached the desired consistency and flavor, remove it from the heat. Transfer it to a gravy boat or serving bowl and serve hot alongside roasted meats, mashed potatoes, biscuits, or any dish of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
